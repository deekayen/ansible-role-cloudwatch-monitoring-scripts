[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bitintheskud/ansible-role-cloudwatch-logs-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bitintheskud/ansible-role-cloudwatch-logs-agent)

## Introduction

An Ansible role to install AWS Cloudwatch Logs agent on CentOS.

In case you can't afford to run Amazon Linux, this role will install the cloudwatch agent on centos.

Current status :

  -  CentOS 7 --> Tested.
  -  CentOS 6 --> Not tested (Contributor welcome !)

Please see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/QuickStartEC2Instance.html

## Prerequisites

**AMI**

This role assumes you run an AMI provide by CentOS on AWS market place (free of charge).

To find the latest AMI from Centos for your AWS region you can run the command below.

```
aws --region eu-west-1 ec2 describe-images \
    --owners aws-marketplace \
    --filters Name=product-code,Values=aw0evgkw8e5c1q413zgy5pjce \
    --query 'sort_by(Images, &CreationDate)[-1].[ImageId]' \
    --output 'text'
```

**Monitoring scripts for linux**

We also install the monitoring script for linux to monitor memory, cpu, swap, etc.
You need to have a role attach to the instance (or credentials) in order to be able to write to cloudwatch.

See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/mon-scripts.html


## Usage

Include the folder in your roles directory.

If you want to run this playbook locally you can do the following.

Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bitintheskud/ansible-role-cloudwatch-logs-agent.git

Create a local ansible playbook with the role included.

```Shell

  hosts: 127.0.0.1
  become: yes
  roles:
    - { role: '<YOUR PATH>/ansible-role-cloudwatch-logs-agent' }
```
